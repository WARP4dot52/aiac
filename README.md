aiac ( /eÉªk/ )  
is  
a  
calculator  
  
aiac is a simple RPN(not really lol) calculator writen in C  
it serve no actual purpose, it was mainly written as an educational project for myself  
that's why some code is, on purpose, way too complex for what it is  
  
writen with vs22  
it should be portable  
note: if you want to run it on a non-windows system, use the 'unix' branch, due to the non-standard "scanf_s" required on windows  
  
if you want to add any cool feature just do a pull request.
