aiac ( /eÉªk/ )  
is  
a  
calculator  
  
aiac is a simple RPN calculator writen in C  
it serve no actual purpose, it was mainly written as an educational project for myself  
that's why some code is, on purpose, way too complex for what it is  
  
writen with vs22  
it should be portable  
note: it may need to be edited a little bit for it to run on non-windows systems , notably due to the non-standard "scanf_s" required on windows  
but anyone with basic C knowlege (optional) and an half working brain (optional ;) should be able to make it work on all systems quite easily  
  
if you want to add any cool feature just do a pull request.
